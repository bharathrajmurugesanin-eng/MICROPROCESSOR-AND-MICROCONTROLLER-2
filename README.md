2.Write an assembly language program in 8051 to generate a 10 ms delay using Timer 1 in Mode 1 and toggle an LED connected to Port 1.0 continuously.

# AIM
To develop an 8051 microcontroller assembly program that uses Timer 1 in Mode 1 to generate a 10 ms delay and toggles an LED connected to Port 1.0. 8051.

# APPARATUS REQUIRED
8051 Microcontroller Trainer Kit (or simulator like Keil uVision, Proteus, or 8051 IDE) LED (connected to Port 2.0) 10kÎ© Resistor (as current limiter) Connecting Wires & Breadboard (for practical hardware) Computer with IDE/Assembler for code development and simulation.

# ALGORITHM
Set Port 1.0 as an output by initializing it low (P1.0 = 0). Configure Timer 1 in Mode.Load Timer 1 registers with TH1 = 0xDC and TL1 = 0x00 to obtain a 10 ms delay at 12 MHz. Clear TF1, start Timer 1 (TR1 = 1), and wait until TF1 becomes 1. Stop Timer 1 (TR1 = 0) and clear TF1. Toggle the state of Port 1.0 (P1 ^= 0x01). Repeat the delay and toggle steps indefinitely inside the main loop.

# PROGRAM
#include<reg51.h>

void delay();

void main()
{
    P1 = 0x00;
   TMOD = 0x10;  
    while(1){
        P1 = 0xFF;
        delay();
        P1 = 0x00;
        delay();
    }
}

void delay()
{
    TH1 = 0xDC;  
    TL1 = 0x00;  
    TR1 = 1;     
    while(TF1 == 0);  
    TR1 = 0;     
    TF1 = 0;     
}

# RESULT
Successfully designed and verified an 8051 Assembly program to toggle an LED at Port 1.0 with a precise 10 ms interval using Timer 1 in Mode 1. Demonstrated timer initialization, delay loop, and I/O port manipulation in 8051 Assembly.
